# Feedreader Testing

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

I added a series of tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework.




## Requirements

All the required dependencies are included in the project.

Open `index.html` to run.

Results of the tests are at the end of the page.

Test suites source code is in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`
